A TFS build light, based around a cheap model yak and a raspberry pi. Yeah, baby!

So, we had an idea. What if we took a figurine of a shaved yak, drilled out its eyes, replaced them with multicoloured LED, added a speaker, connected it to a TFS build server, and made it moo when a build failed? 

Yeah. I know. Best project ever.
